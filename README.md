This i an implementaion of weather Chatbot using RASA frameworks.To fetch the weather details of the aked city.

To collect the weather data,we have to use an API, because weather is not a static entity, keeps on changing. So we can use any open source weather API provider. Here, I chose the https://openweathermap.org for itâ€™s simplicity. You have to just sign-in into the site and then in the API keys section an API key is provided to access their data.
